Fetal heart rate monitoring cardiotocography
prediction using Decision Tree and Random Forest
algorithm with R language.
This study demonstrated the potential of ML methods,
specifically the decision tree algorithm, in predicting
fetal distress by monitoring fetal heart rate. The model
achieved high accuracy rates in both training and testing
sets, indicating its usefulness as a decision-support tool
for obstetric care. The low rate of false positives and
false negatives further highlights the model's
effectiveness in identifying fetal distress with high
sensitivity and specificity.
